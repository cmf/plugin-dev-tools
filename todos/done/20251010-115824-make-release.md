## Original Todo
- Make a release with the latest fixes

## Description
Create version 0.0.4 release of plugin-dev-tools to publish the UnixPath coercion bug fix. This is a patch release that fixes a critical error in the marketplace plugin functionality introduced in 0.0.3. The release process for this project is minimal - it only requires creating and pushing an annotated git tag, as the project is consumed via deps.edn git dependencies.

*Read [analysis.md](./analysis.md) in full for detailed codebase research and context*

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Verify working directory is clean and all changes are committed (git status)
- [x] Create annotated git tag 0.0.4 with release notes about the UnixPath bug fix
- [x] Push tag to origin remote repository
- [x] Automated test: Verify tag exists locally and on remote (git tag -l and git ls-remote --tags)
- [x] User test: Confirm tag is visible on GitHub and can be consumed via git deps

## Notes
Version 0.0.4 is a patch release containing only the UnixPath coercion bug fix from commit 50af029.
